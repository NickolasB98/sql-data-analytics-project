# SQL Advanced Analytics Project

## üìå Overview

A collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, etc. This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

This project replicates industry-standard SQL analytics workflows, focusing on actionable insights for business stakeholders. 
It utilizes a PostgreSQL database named `SalesDB` to perform several types of analyses, including:

- **Customer Reporting:** Generating a detailed report on customer demographics, purchase behavior, and engagement.
- **Product Reporting:** Creating a comprehensive report on product performance, sales trends, and inventory management.
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis:** Understanding the contribution of different categories to overall sales.
- **Performance Analysis:** Comparing sales performance over time (month-over-month and year-over-year).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the `customer_report` and `product_report` views to understand the data.

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

The `SalesDB` database consists of the following tables:

- **`dim_customers`:** Stores customer demographic information (e.g., name, age, location).
- **`dim_products`:** Contains product details (e.g., product name, category, price).
- **`fact_sales`:** Records sales transaction data (e.g., transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, sales amount, date).

The project also creates finalized gold views to organize data for reporting and analysis:

- **`report_customers`:** A view used for customer reporting.
- **`report_products`:** A view used for product reporting.

### Finalized Gold Views:
To streamline reporting and analysis, the project creates two key views:
- **`report_customers`:** A consolidated view for customer-related reporting.
- **`report_products`:** A consolidated view for product-related reporting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Scripts Examples and Analyses

### 1. **Customer Reporting**
- **Script:** `customer_report.sql`
