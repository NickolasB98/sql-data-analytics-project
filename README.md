# SQL Data Analytics Portfolio Project

## Real-world project demonstrating trend analysis, performance tracking, segmentation, and automated reporting using SQL.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

A collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, etc. This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

This project replicates industry-standard SQL analytics workflows, focusing on actionable insights for business stakeholders. 
It utilizes a PostgreSQL database named `SalesDB` to perform several types of analyses, including:

- **Customer Reporting:** Generating a detailed report on customer demographics, purchase behavior, and engagement.
- **Product Reporting:** Creating a comprehensive report on product performance, sales trends, and inventory management.
- **Part-to-Whole Analysis:** Understanding the contribution of different categories to overall sales.
- **Performance Analysis:** Comparing sales performance over time (month-over-month and year-over-year).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the `customer_report` and `product_report` views to understand the data.

## Database Schema

The `SalesDB` database includes the following tables:

- **`dim_customers`:** Contains customer demographic information.
- **`dim_products`:** Contains product information.
- **`fact_sales`:** Contains sales transaction data.

The project also creates finalized gold views to organize data for reporting and analysis:

- **`report_customers`:** A view used for customer reporting.
- **`report_products`:** A view used for product reporting.
